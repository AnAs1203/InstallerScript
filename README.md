This is a script that will automatically for you, download the app that i made using Avalonia UI, in C# .NET. The installer script works only for linux distributions (latest versions and fully updated (supported package managers are apt, dnf, pacman and zypper)). The script automatically downloads the prerequisites, clones into the app repository, then configures it for you so you can easily just run the script that automatically is saved at ~/ folder. THE APP AND THE SCRIPT WORK ONLY FOR LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS, WINDOWS IS NOT SUPPORTED. This is my introduction to real bash scripting and real implementations of it, i tried my best, the script does 100% have some holes, but it works!
